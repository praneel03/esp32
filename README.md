Audio file sharing in ESP32 over BLUETOOTH

I want to send a audio file (MUSIC) from my mobile (Android) over BLUETOOTH. First of all that file should save in sd (memory) card and then same file (MUSIC) should go to amplifier (speaker). Does anyone know how I can receive the file with the ESP32 and save it into sd (memory) card?

(Is it possible to share MUSIC/AUDIO files over BLUETOOTH in esp32 and store it in sd card and send same signal to amplifier (for speaker))

Best regards praneel03
